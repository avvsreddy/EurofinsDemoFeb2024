------BASIC SQL LABS ----------------


Here are 25 SQL select query exercises based on the `emp` and 'dept' table for practice:

1. Retrieve all columns for all employees.
2. Retrieve the names and job titles of all employees.
3. Retrieve the unique department numbers from the `emp` table.
4. Retrieve the names of employees hired after January 1, 1982.
5. Retrieve the names of employees whose job title is 'Manager.'
6. Retrieve the names and salaries of employees earning more than 2500.
7. Retrieve the names, job titles, and salaries of employees hired in department 20.
8. Retrieve the names of employees who don't have a manager (`mgr` is NULL).
9. Retrieve the average salary of all employees.
10. Retrieve the highest salary from the `emp` table.
11. Retrieve the names of employees who earn the highest salary.
12. Retrieve the names and hire dates of employees hired in 1981.
13. Retrieve the names of employees who work in departments located in 'New York.'
14. Retrieve the names of employees who work in departments with a location containing 'Los Angeles.'
15. Retrieve the names of employees whose salary is in the range of 2000 to 3000.
16. Retrieve the names of employees in department 30 with a salary greater than 1500.
17. Retrieve the names of employees in department 10 or department 20.
18. Retrieve the names of employees who have a commission (`comm`) value.
19. Retrieve the names of employees whose names start with the letter 'S.'
20. Retrieve the names of employees whose names end with the letter 'E.'
21. Retrieve the names of employees whose names contain the letter 'A.'
22. Retrieve the names of employees in department 20 who have 'Clerk' in their job title.
23. Retrieve the names of employees who work in the same department as 'Jones' (use a subquery).
24. Retrieve the names and salaries of employees sorted by salary in ascending order.
25. Retrieve the names of employees with the same job title as 'King' but different employee numbers.

These exercises cover a variety of SQL query scenarios that you can use to practice your SQL skills with the `emp` table. You can modify and expand upon these exercises to further challenge yourself.


---- Advanced SQL Labs -----

Here are 10 SQL lab exercises that involve using the `emp`, `dept`, and `salgrade` tables with various types of joins:

**Lab 1: Retrieve Employee Details with Department Names**
Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of employees along with their department names.

**Lab 2: Retrieve Employee Details with Job Titles**
Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of employees along with their job titles.

**Lab 3: Retrieve Department Names with Locations**
Write a SQL query to retrieve department names along with their respective locations.

**Lab 4: Retrieve Employee Names and Salaries with Department Names**
Write a SQL query to retrieve the names and salaries of employees along with their department names.

**Lab 5: Retrieve Employee Names, Job Titles, and Salary Grades**
Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of employees, their job titles, and the salary grade they fall into.

**Lab 6: Retrieve Employee Names with Manager Names**
Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of employees along with the names of their managers.

**Lab 7: Retrieve Employee Names with Commission Amounts**
Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of employees along with their commission amounts (if any).

**Lab 8: Retrieve Department Names with Average Salaries**
Write a SQL query to retrieve department names along with the average salary of employees in each department.

**Lab 9: Retrieve Employee Names with Department Names and Locations**
Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of employees along with their department names and locations.

**Lab 10: Retrieve Employee Names with Job Titles and Salary Ranges**
Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of employees, their job titles, and the salary range (low salary and high salary) associated with their salary grade.

Each of these lab exercises involves different types of joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) between the `emp`, `dept`, and `salgrade` tables. These exercises should help you practice SQL skills related to retrieving and combining data from multiple tables.
